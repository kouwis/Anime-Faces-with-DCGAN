# Anime-Faces-with-DCGAN

In this repository we generate Anime Face images with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This is my first experience with GAN, which I implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 platform.

Data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces. Here are sample images from the dataset

I use a slightly modified DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) for the task at hand.
